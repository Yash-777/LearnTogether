A JSON Schema is itself JSON, describing types, required fields, and
constraints for another JSON document.

Schema:
  {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["id", "email"],
    "properties": {
      "id": { "type": "number" },
      "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" }
    }
  }

A document missing "email", or with id as a string, fails validation
against this schema - catching bad data before it reaches your code.
