JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) supports exactly 6 value types:
string, number, boolean, null, object, and array. There are no dates,
no functions, no comments - if you need those, you're extending JSON
with a convention on top of it (e.g. ISO date strings).

Example:
  {
    "name": "Ana",
    "active": true,
    "score": 87.5,
    "tags": ["a", "b"],
    "manager": null
  }
